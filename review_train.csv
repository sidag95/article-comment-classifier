AllTime,Keep posting other movies with big product placements..﻿,11,3
LittleBilazer,I am disappointed to not find movie called Evolution on the list.﻿,1,3
Saven,I really enjoy product placement. It's more realistic and it gives a sense of personalization. I don't want one popular American movie to contain some knockoff brand like Cloak of Cloa or Bud Right. Plus the companies get compensation for their brand to be in the movie and the production process is more funded. Everybody wins.﻿,1, 4
Abc123,Worst product placement ever is on the (bad) horror film Demons (1985). In the film there are scenes where a group of punk criminals snort cocaine... From a coca-cola can. Not a generic cola the actual brand and perfectly visible. How it was possible is beyond my imagination.﻿,4,4
ConvinveLee, 10s Was anyone else unfortunate enough to have gone and seen "Focus" with Will Smith? that movie has a 2 minute montage of the new Dodge Durango driving down an empty street. then they crash it and destroy another car then pan around the Durango to show how little damage it got. there was literally a 4 minute car add in that movie! and it was better than the rest of the film....﻿,1,4
